## Specific Usage

###### *You need to download/clone this repo to your local to use these:*

### SNAP - Snap Popup Viewer

If you are testing `Snap transaction token request` you will get response like:
```
{ "token": "bffb82ff-f8bb-4651-86b0-0c2316b77c0a" }
```
To see how that token works, you can open file `../snap-opener/index.html` in your web browser to preview the SNAP payment page.
- Tips: you can also append snap token like this in url `../snap-opener/index.html?snap_token=bffb82ff-f8bb-4651-86b0-0c2316b77c0a&is_production=false`

You can also edit file `snap/index.html` and insert your own token to the HTML, then open in web browser.

###### *This file is for snap token viewer only, you should not use this for integration reference, for front-end integration sample, see below section*

### SNAP - Snap Front-End Integration Example

For real example on how you can use Snap token in your website front-end, you can see sample minimum implementation here:
`../sample-frontend/index.html`

> Edit the file and insert `<Your-Client-Key-Here>` with your client key.

### Core API - Credit Card Get Token & 3DS Authenticate Example

To get credit card token for Core API Credit Card charge process & how to open 3ds redirect_url, here's [sample implementation that you can check](/coreAPI-CreditCardFrontend/index.html). (mandiri clickpay also need get token process).

> Don't forget to change client_key to your client key inside that file.

## Production Mode

All endpoint used in this postman collection is for `sandbox transaction`, to switch to `production` change endpoint URL from:

`https://api.sandbox.midtrans.com/../..`

to

`https://api.midtrans.com/../..`

(Just remove the `sandbox.` from url)

## Troubleshooting

If you get error
```
{
  "error_messages": [
    "Access denied due to unauthorized transaction, please check client or server key",
    "Visit https://snap-docs.midtrans.com/#request-headers for more details"
  ]
}
```
- Please make sure you do step 4-7 properly like instructed in **[Usage Instruction](#usage-instruction)** section.
- Please make sure you are using correct **Server Key** (Serverkey for sandbox & production are different).
